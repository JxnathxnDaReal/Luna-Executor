# Luna-Executor
read the README file to follow the steps to downloading this!!

first step: Download Visual Studio https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

second step: select .NET desktop development.

third step: select .NET Framework 4.8 on the side of Visual Studio (pretty sure this is optional)

fourth step: press Install at the bottom-left of Visual Studio.

fifth step: once it's done installing, press launch.

sixth step: create an account or sign in.

seventh step: Create a new project once you're on the main menu.

Eight steps: Search for the template " Windows Form App (.NET framework)." Be careful with the one you choose because there are multiple. The correct one should have a C# on the icon.

ninth step: name your project some nonsense and then select .NET framework 4.8 (this is optional too, you can select 4.7.2 too but JUST in case.)

tenth step: once the project is done loading, press save all at the top-left.

eleventh step: Open File Explorer and type this at the path search bar "C:\Users" (the search bar at the top of the file explorer NOT the top right search bar)

twelfth step: select your user and find the folder named "source".

thirteenth step: click on repos. Now, don't select what you named your project earlier, instead add the zip file in repos and extract it.

fourteenth step: open the Luna folder, then open the Luna in the folder that you extracted, then open the bin folder, then the Debug folder. Now, for the FINAL STEP. open the application named "Luna".

CONGRATULATIONS! now you have Luna installed. Open Roblox, join a game, then press inject.

I gave y'all some scripts you can use :P
